# hello-world-leorre

My name is Leorre Newman (and in human language: just "Lior")

This is excercise 6.
I used my previous work from the former exercises,
therefore "AmSagolVolunteering.html", for example, is not linked to a css file.


2 files are not related:
"MainPage - Copy for Arseni's Part.html" and "listUsers-arseni.html" -> those are for assignment 7 (arseni).
